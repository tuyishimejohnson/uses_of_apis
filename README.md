A small website that uses API to suggest movies.

API stands for Application Programming Interfaces, in which multiple computer systems are communicating and interacting with each other. It enables the website or web applications to request and receive data or services from external sources.

To utilize APIs:

1. You have to choose an API to use: The APIs that are relative to the function of your website.
2. Creating a website that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript as usual.
3. Connecting that API with the JavaScript file to handle the API call and the integration with the HTML.
4. Finally you have to ensure whether the API is working

This small webpage is suggesting users the movies to watch. When the user clicks on the suggest me a movie button, it displays one movie. When the user refreshes and click again, it shows a different movie.
